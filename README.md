# Photo Wake-Up: 3D Character Animation from a Single Photo

In recent years, tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of 3D Machine Learning, which is an interdisciplinary field that fuses computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. Photo wake-up belongs to that field. Researchers at the University of Washington have developed this technique for animating a human subject (such as walking toward the screen, running, sitting, and jumping) from a single photo. The technique is demonstrated by using a variety of singleimage inputs, including photographs, realistic illustrations, cartoon drawings, and abstracted human forms. The output animation can be played as a video, viewed interactively on a monitor, and as an augmented or virtual reality experience, where a user with headset can enjoy the central figure of a photo coming out into the real world.

***Figure 1***: Given a single photo as input (far left), model creates a 3D animatable version of the subject, which can now walk towards the viewer (middle). The 3D result can be experienced in augmented reality (right); in the result above the user has virtually hung the artwork with a HoloLens headset and can watch the character run out of the painting from different views.
