It can be seen that some of the vertices show little variability over the training set, while others form more diffuse \"clouds.\" The Point Distribution Model (PDM) seeks to model the variation of the coordinates within these clouds. However, it must be remembered that landmarks do not move about independently their positions are partially correlated.\n",

    "Thus a set of N example shapes gives a cloud of N points in this 2n dimensional space. We assume that these points lie within some region of the space,which we call the ***Allowable Shape Domain*** or ***Shape Space*** and that the points give an indication of the shape and size of this region. Every 2n-D point within this domain gives a set of landmarks whose shape is broadly similar to that of those in the original training set. Thus by moving about the Allowable Shape Domain we can generate new shapes in a systematic way. The approach given below attempts to model the shape of this cloud in a high dimensional space, and hence to capture the relationships between the positions of the individual landmark points. We make the assumption that the cloud is approximately ellipsoidal, and proceed to calculate its center (giving a mean shape) and its major axes, which give a way of moving around the cloud.\n",
