    "Our shape space is defined by a mean and principal shape directions $\\{ \\bar{T}, \\mathcal{S} \\}$. It is computed by running PCA on shape registrations from our multi-shape database after pose normalization. Pose normalization transforms a raw registration $V_j^S$ into a registration, $\\hat{T}_j^S$, in the rest pose, $\\theta^*$. This normalization is critical to ensure that pose and shape are modeled separately.\n",

    "Note that the optimization of pose is critically important when building a shape basis from vertices. Without this step, pose variations of the subjects in the shape training dataset would be captured in the shape blend shapes. The resulting model would not be decomposed properly into shape and pose. Note also that this approach constrasts with SCAPE or BlendSCAPE, where PCA is performed in the space of per-triangle deformations. Unlike vertices, triangle deformations do not live in a Euclidean space.  Hence PCA on vertices is more principled and is consistent with the registration data term, which consists of squared vertex disparities."
