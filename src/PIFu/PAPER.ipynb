    "> In mathematics, a ***level set*** of a real-valued function f of n real variables is a set of the form $L_c(f) = \\{ (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) | f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = c \\}$, that is, a set where the function takes on a given constant value c. When the number of variables is two, a level set is generically a curve, called a ***level curve***, ***contour line***, or ***isoline***. So a level curve is the set of all real-valued solutions of an equation in two variables x1 and x2. When n = 3, a level set is called a ***level surface*** or ***isosurface***, and for higher values of n the level set is a level ***hypersurface***. So a level surface is the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in three variables x1, x2 and x3, and a level hypersurface is the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in n (n > 3) variables."

    "> When you take a photograph, you need to move and rotate the camera to adjust the viewpoint. So in a way, when you transform a camera (by translating and rotating it â€” note that scaling a camera doesn't make much sense), what you actually do is transforming a local coordinate system which implicitly represents the transformations applied to that camera. In CG (computer graphics) we call this spatial reference system (the term spatial reference system or reference, is sometimes used in place of coordinate system), the ***camera coordinate*** system (you might also find it called the eye coordinate system in other references). Cameras point along the world coordinate system negative z-axis so that when a point is converted from world space to camera space (and then later from camera space to screen space), if the point is to left of the world coordinate system y-axis, it will also map to the left of the camera coordinate system y-axis. In other words, we need the x-axis of the camera coordinate system to point to the right when the world coordinate system x-axis also points to the right; and the only way you can get that configuration, is by having camera looking down the negative z-axis. Because of this, the sign of the z coordinate of points is inverted when we go from one system to the other."
