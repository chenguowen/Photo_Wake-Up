    "This dataset contains 2000 pose annotated images of mostly sports people. The images have been scaled such that the most prominent person is roughly 150 pixels in length. Each image has been annotated with 14 joint locations. In paper the dataset was split into two parts for training and testing. The first 1000 images (im0001.jpg to im1000.jpg) were used for training and strictly ALL parameter selection. The second 1000 images (im1001.jpg to im2000.jpg) were used for testing. The ordering of the joints is as follows:\n",

Each image has a corresponding annotation gathered from Amazon Mechanical Turk and as such cannot be guaranteed to be highly accurate. The images have been scaled such that the annotated person is roughly 150 pixels in length. Each image has been annotated with up to 14 visible joint locations.

Each image was extracted from a YouTube video and provided with preceding and following un-annotated frames. In addition, for the test set we obtained richer annotations including body part occlusions and 3D torso and head orientations."
